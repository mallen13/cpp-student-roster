# C++ Student System

The aim of the project is to create a C++ application to maintain a current roster of students within a given course.

# Competencies Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following competencies:

Programming
Variables and Data Types
Control Structures
Arrays
Pointers and Memory
Functions
Object-Oriented Paradigm

## Scenario

As a contractor, you are hired by a university to migrate an existing student system to a new platform using the C++ language. The requirements for the project are outlined below. You will need to implement the part of the system based on these requirements.

## Requirements

The program should contain two classes (i.e., Student and Roster) to read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray.

The student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.

You must write code to manipulate this data according to the following requirements:

Parse the data and add each student to the classRosterArray.
Print out a list of all the students.
Print out a list of all the students whose email addresses are invalid.
Print out the average number of days it takes to complete a course for a student in the classRosterArray by student ID.
Remove the student with the specified ID from the classRosterArray.
Print out a list of all the students.
Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. You must also provide evidence of the programâ€™s required functionality by taking a screen capture of the console run, saved as an image file.

## Dependencies

This project does not require any third-party libraries.

## Building and Running
